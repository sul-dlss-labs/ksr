                        <p>San Francisco Chronicle, reports, "California is trying to remove racist rules from housing documents. But we need to do more." This year, California Assembly members Kevin McCarty, D-Sacramento; Autumn Burke, D-Los Angeles; David Chiu, D-San Francisco; and state Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco will introduce legislation that removes racial covenants from deeds whenever the property is transferred or sold.

                        <p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) has resulted in hundreds of millions of cases and millions of deaths worldwide, hitting the entire world at an unprecedented rate, resulting in a global pandemic. The country is on a heightened sense of tension and unrest due to this pandemic. On top of COVID-19, there have also been racial tensions as well. The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement has taken the country by storm, spurring protests about racial inequalities, particularly as a result of police brutality, the black community faces.
